In this directory are reference headers/files for things that already
exist in OS X (taken here from their relevant SDKs),
but need a proper re-implementation in this repository anyways.

I populated the OS-specific subdirs in reverse-chronological order,
starting with 10.6 and working my way backwards. I skipped over
10.3.9.sdk and 10.3.internal.sdk, because they were just "sparse" SDKs
populated by a few headers from darwinbuild at the time
that I was doing this.

Update: I have since found the SDKs for 10.7-10.9; those were populated
in regular chronological order (i.e. forwards instead of reverse)
