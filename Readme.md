Started off as misc. compatibility code taken from
Apple's ["Porting UNIX/Linux Applications to OS X"](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/intro/intro.html) developer documentation,
ended up being mostly gnulib sources with some OSX-related tinkering

Note: This is incomplete, see TODO (and FIXMES.txt and XXX.txt) for more on
what remains to be done.
