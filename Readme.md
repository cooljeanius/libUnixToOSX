This repo started off as misc. compatibility code taken from
Apple's ["Porting UNIX/Linux Applications to OS X"](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/intro/intro.html) developer documentation,
and has ended up being mostly [gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/) sources with some OSX-related tinkering.

Note: This is incomplete, see `TODO` (and `FIXMES.txt` and `XXX.txt`) for more on
what remains to be done.
