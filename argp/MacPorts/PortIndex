It was separated off glibc by Niels Myller. Niels primary use it for inclusion in the LSH distribution, but it's useful for any package that wants to use argp and at the same time be portable to non-glibc systems. Besides portability fixes, there are a few other changes in this version. The most important is that it no longer builds upon {getopt;} the one or two hairy functions of GNU getopt are incorporated with the argp parser. There are no longer any global variables keeping track of the parser state.} license LGPL maintainers nomaintainer categories devel version 1.3 revision 1
